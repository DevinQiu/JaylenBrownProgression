                <h2>Bio</h2>
                
                    <p>Jaylen Brown was drafted #3 in the 2016 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics. In a draft that many experts had considered a "two player draft", Jaylen had a limited role on the 2016-2017 Celtics team after being buried on the depth chart and getting accustomed to NBA level competition. Jaylen was drafted as a raw prospect with elite physical tools. The hope was that he would develop into an elite 3-and-D wing player in the mold of Kawhi Leonard,Paul George or Jimmy Butler. This year he has shown flashes of brillance and significant improvement.

                <h3>Defense</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                       To be honest I didn't really get the hype of how good of a defender Jaylen was in his rookie year. He played limited minutes in his rookie campaign and seemed average at best. The 2016-2017 Celtics were also middle of the pack in defensive rating so it was hard to see Jaylens impact. Jaylen also had the benefit of playing alongside two great defensive guards in Marcus Smart and future all defensive first teamer Avery Bradley. With only two weeks left in the regular season, the Celtics still have the <a href="https://stats.nba.com/teams/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&dir=-1">#1 defensive rating</a> in the nba. Jaylen had big steps to fill this year after free agent Avery Bradley departed during the off-season. Not only has Jaylen started in place of Bradley but he has excelled defensively at the shooting guard position. Among players with more than 40 games played and 25 minutes per, <a href="http://stats.nba.com/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&dir=-1&CF=GP*GE*40:MIN*GE*25&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season">Jaylen(100.0) is the 5th rated defender at any position in the NBA.</a> He ranks second among guards,trailing teammate Marcus Smart(99.4). Not only is Jaylen holding his own as a starter, he is locking down opponents. Jaylen has very impressive physical attributes: 
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Height:6'7</li>
                            <li>Weight:225</li>
                            <li>Very Fast</li>
                            <li>Insane Athletcism</li>
                            <li>High Vertical Jump</li>
                            <li>Wing Span:7'0</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        Put all of these together and you have a very versatile defender that is also a match up nightmare for other teams. He's big,fast and strong. Basically a mini-Lebron. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBziHM0gKrY">Here</a> you can see Jaylen defend DeMar DeRozan on the last possesion of a close game. DeRozan is also a big guard (6'7) and is one of the leagues most talented scorers especially in isolation plays. Jaylen stays in front of DeRozan the whole time which cuts off any attempt to drive to the rim and plays him close enough without fouling that DeRozan has to take a very contested mid range shot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqJAAEhqjUE">Here</a> we see Jaylen's speed on display as he defends Kemba Walker. Kemba is quite small (6'1) but he can score with the best of them. He uses his speed to get by defenders to drive to the hoop or create seperation on shots. This video shows that the 6'7 Jaylen is fast enough to keep up with the speedy Kemba Walker and is able to use his 7'0 wingpspan to contest and block two shots. Jaylen is not intimated by anyone in the league, not even future hall of famer Lebron James.

                <h3>3 Point Shooting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let's have a look at Jaylen's shooting splits from college below.                      
                    
            
                    <script type="text/javascript" src="//widgets.sports-reference.com/wg.fcgi?css=1&site=bbr&url=%2Fplayers%2Fb%2Fbrownja02.html&div=div_all_college_stats"></script>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        The categories you want to be paying attention to are FG%, 3P% and FT%. They stand for field goal percentage, 3 point percentage, and free throw percentage. Putting Jaylen's numbers in this order would end up as .431, .294, .654. You may be wondering what these numbers mean. The average shooting percentage for an NBA player in the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html"> 2017-2018 season is .460, .362, .768. </a> These numbers are especially bad because the averaged numbers include bigger players like centers that are 7'0 tall and tend to have worse shooting numbers, thus bring the averages down. Elite shooting splits would look something like .500, .400, and .900. (Also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50%E2%80%9340%E2%80%9390_club">50-40-90 club</a> which is a very exclusive club even by nba standards.) Does being a bad shooter in college doom you to be terrible forever? It depends entirely on the individual and how they progress. Shooting splits from college are a good indicator for how a player will project at the next level but they are flawed in many ways as well. There are so many things to factor that can impact these numbers such as but not limited to: strength of collegiate conferences, how "good" your own team was, whether you were the main scoring option on your team and team play style. Let's have a look below at Jaylen's numbers since entering the NBA.
                        
                        <br>
                        
            
                    <script type="text/javascript" src="//widgets.sports-reference.com/wg.fcgi?css=1&site=bbr&url=%2Fplayers%2Fb%2Fbrownja02.html&div=div_totals"></script>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        Jaylen's shooting splits in his first season in the NBA (2016-2017) were very surprising. Coming in at .454, .341, and .685. These were all increases from his numbers in college so this was a good sign that he transitioned well from college to the NBA. However, Jaylen still struggles greatly with his free throws. Shooting in the 60s is really bad but the good thing is that free throws are mostly a mental issue instead of a mechanical issue. Comparing Jaylen's shooting splits from his rookie year to this year show slight increases except for free throws (we'll get to this in the next section.) However, you have to consider that Jaylen has played almost 50% more minutes and taken 50% more shots that he did last season. He has also taken on a larger role this year as the number 3 option on the team compared to being on the bench last year as a "6 man". Jaylen has progressed very well this year showing that he can take on more responsibility on offense while maintaining his shooting splits and playing borderline elite defense. Below you will find a video from a couple of days ago where Jaylen buries a game winning 3 in a tied game against the Utah Jazz, who have number two ranked defense in the NBA.
